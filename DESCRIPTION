Description: Single (i) Cell R package (iCellR) is an interactive R package to work with high-throughput single cell sequencing technologies (i.e scRNA-seq, scVDJ-seq and CITE-seq). iCellR is an R package that allows scientists unprecedented flexibility at every step of the analysis pipeline, including normalization, clustering, dimensionality reduction, imputation, visualization, and so on. iCellR allows users to design both unsupervised and supervised models to best suit their research. In addition, iCellR provides 2D and 3D interactive visualizations, differential expression analysis, filters based on cells, genes and clusters, data merging, normalizing for dropouts and filling them with imputation methods, batch differences, pathway analysis and tools to find marker genes for clusters and conditions, predict cell types and pseudotime analysis.
